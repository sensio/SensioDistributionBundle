Thanks @CthulhuDen.

This should target 4.0 branch.

You can either rebase and change the target thanks to GitHub's new feature by clicking on "edit" on the title of the PR, or we can handle it on merge.

@HeahDude I tried to do that, but it seems it now tries to merge master into 4.0. Perhaps I should just open another PR.

@CthulhuDen If you don't know how to rebase on 4.0, just reset the target branch to master, we will handle it on merge. Thank you.

@HeahDude I just checked, this bug is not in 4.0 branch, it was introduced during merge.

Nice, thanks again :)

Any ideas when this will be applied?
