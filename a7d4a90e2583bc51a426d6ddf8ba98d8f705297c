rather than a separate upgrade file for each version, I would rather have a single upgrade file (the changes needed for each major version upgrade are small)

I'll rename the file, I think I can leave the contents the same as for each major another line of heading can be added.

You could add the other two bc breaks as well. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/2.8/UPGRADE-2.8.md
But they need to be rephrased from the perspective of this bundle and not symfony SE.

the removal of the web configurator is a v4 BC break btw, not a v5 one.

@stof I had to delete the configurator when upgrading from v4 to v5. Unless I'm missing something it's a v5 break.

EDIT: this file would've helped a lot earlier today :) +1

ah indeed. The v3 to v4 BC break was the removal of the AcmeDemoBundle installation. My bad

PR is updated, I've pretty much used the existing text that @Tobion linked.
