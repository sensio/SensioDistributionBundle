What about removing existing step from the configurator?

@gquemener I think it's beyond the scope of this PR. It was not possible to remove existing steps before and this PR is feature equivalent, except the possibility to add steps.

Is it OK ?

:+1: @fabpot can this please be merged? I would like to use this in the Symfony CMF to add some CMF specific things.
