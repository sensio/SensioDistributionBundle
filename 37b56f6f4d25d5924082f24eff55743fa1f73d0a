@mhujer thanks for proposing this improvement and for your excellent explanation.

Although I don't use Windows, I did some tests on my computer. The default `realpath_cache_size` was 16K and I changed it to 5000K as you suggested. A quick test on a complex Symfony app gave me a 5% CPU time gain. I need to do more tests, but this change looks promising indeed.

It'd be great if some Windows users could share their thoughts (and tests) about this proposal. Ping @WouterJ

I did a quick test with the Symfony demo application using PHP 5.5.12 on Windows 8.1 using Wamp and I can't see any major performance changes when setting this value to 1024 or 5000k (did some very basic tests however).
