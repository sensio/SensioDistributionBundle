What about removing version 3 and 4 as they won't work anymore anyway?

I certainly can, my only worry would be about dependency conflicts with other bundles that may not have updated yet. If that's not really a worry I can push an update to remove v3 and v4.

Not an issue as Composer will then use an older version of this package.

Ok thanks, I just wanted to check! I've pushed a new update that only includes v5 of the security checker.
